Through establishing a safe outlet and resources for sexual assault victims, we hope to abolish the victim-blaming cultural norm and encourage women to voice their stories. Together, we can raise awareness of sexual assault, and start a movement. We hope that you will join us on this journey. </p> \r\n    </div>\r\n    <div id=\"section3\" class=\"container-fluid\"><h3>Myths Debunked</h3>\r\n    \t<p> \r\n        <ol>\r\n          <li>\"Rape is about sex.\"</li>\r\n    FALSE. Rape is not about sex; rather it is about power and control. Rape is an act of violence and it cannot be justified by sexual desires.\r\n          <li>\"Sexual perpetrators are usually strangers, who are mentally ill.\"</li>\r\n    FALSE. In 8 out of 10 cases of rape, the victim knew the purpose who sexually assaulted them.\r\n          <li>\"Not fighting back means the victim 'wanted it'.\"</li>\r\n    FALSE. During sexual assaults, the victim often experiences a \"freeze response,\" in which he or she physically cannot move or speak. \r\n        </li>\r\n      </ol>\r\n    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div id=\"section4\" class=\"container-fluid\"><h3>About Us</h3>\r\n      <p> \r\n      \t<ul> \r\n      \t\t<li> Wabil Asjad is a rising junior from New Jersey.
